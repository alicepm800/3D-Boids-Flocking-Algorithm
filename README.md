# 3D-Boids-Flocking-Algorithm
3D flocking algorithm created in C++ using the PlayBuffer framework provided by Sumo Digital . Algorithm is based on Reynolds(1986)'s Boids simulation. Includes alignment, cohesion, and separation of Boids. 3D Model created in Blender. Boids wrap around the grid when they collide with a grid edge.
